How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best way I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure is by developing code that directly applies to the software requirements and by thoroughly testing the logic through static and dynamic testing.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I can interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by simply understanding what the requirements are before any code is written.  If I have questions about the requirements, I should seek these answers prior to developing anything.  Usually, if you must interpret anything the requirements are not written properly.

How do I approach designing software?

I have found that the best approach to designing software is to understand the requirements and then write classes that stand alone.  It is also important to only address the items that are captured in the software requirements that the user or customer has asked for.
